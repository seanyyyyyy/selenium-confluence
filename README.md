Automation testing:
- value, coverage, maintainability and robustness
- setting restrictions for different users
- different browsers
- assertion messages helpful
- test names good
- consistently good locators
- don't assume test data exists


Implementation notes:
- wanted to try out selenium-jupiter because it's integration with junit5 and out-of-the-box web browsers, android devices and docker containers sounded interesting

- In terms of Page Object model and locator syntax I followed the official Selenium guidelines
